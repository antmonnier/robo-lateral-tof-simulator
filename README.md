# Robot Lateral TOF Simulator

This project is a web-based simulator for a robot that uses a Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensor looking to its left to maintain a constant distance from a wall using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. The robot aims to keep a distance of 250 units from the wall using PID control.
